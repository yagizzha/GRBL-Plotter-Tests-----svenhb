## History
Needs to be read from the bottom up ;-)  
 
### 2022-01 Version 1.6.4.x 
* Czech language
* Add background pattern for image-import halftone 
 
### 2021-11 Version 1.6.3.x 
* option to show path-nodes (vertices) (=gcode coordinates) of graphics in 2D view (will be switched off on each program start to save recources) - [File - Setup - Program appearance - 2D-View]
* show status of D0-D3 of grbl-Mega-5X enable and set description: [File - Setup - Program behavior - Program start - Pin description]
* new extension "knock-in nut recess" [G-Code Creation - Extensions]
* support VoidMicro controller with just two grbl-axis - not tested, feedback is welcome
* Bugfix: remove short moves
 
### 2021-10 Version 1.6.2.x 
Reworking of the camera form https://grbl-plotter.de/index.php?id=form-camera&setlang=en:
Different camera mountings:
* Fix mount above working area -> fix scaling, fix XY offset
* Mount on XY platform -> fix scaling but variable XY offset
* Mount on Z axis of XY platform -> scaling depends on Z position - sorry, could not be testet
Add quadrilateral transformation to remove distortion caused by camera angle

* Automatic fiducial correction https://grbl-plotter.de/index.php?id=fiducial-correction&setlang=en
* GCode import: take care of G20 inch, large files 100000 lines -> disable some functionality
* Graphics import: huge amount 1000 paths -> disable figureXMLs
* Text creation form - add center alignment


### 2021-09 Version 1.6.1.x 
* #214 Stream selected figure, group or define individual start, stop lines -> right click on stream-button
* #217 2D-View figure color: If Tool table is in use, replace figure colors (original from graphic) by assigned tool colors.
* 2D-View display of tiles: new option: show correct tile position in 2D-view, even if offset of tiles is 0
* #220 Add option to avoid notches in curves
 
 
### 2021-07 Version 1.6.0.x 
- Switch to Visual Studio 2019
- Tried to get rid of all of the visual studio's warnings - with moderate success
- New installer via Inno Setup
- Old: same location as application folder.
New: depending on user privileges during installation:
Administrator: "C:\ProgramData\GrblPlotter\GRBL-Plotter"
User : "C:\Users\John.Doe\AppData\Roaming\GRBL-Plotter\GRBL-Plotter"
 
### 2021-03 Version 1.5.8.x
- Improoved halftone processing 
- Probing dialog: avoid crash into touch plate by keeping "Save distance" higher than "Touch plate dimension" #196 
- Text import: insert line break after reaching certain line length (by estimating an word lengths) #197 

Bug fixes: 
- #188 don't send further grbl-comments to 3rd serial 
- #189 wrong angle of first arrow in 2D-view pen-up path 
- #191 New option for GCode-modification - Split original moves: sent pen-up/down before/after script 
- #192 Overlap paths at tile borders / Display tile borders and numbers 
- #199 "Kill Alarm" didn't worked 
 
 
### 2021-02 Version 1.5.7.x
- New option: ramp down to "Pen-down" position (when using a brush) 
- Text to GCode: Support of SVG Font files (https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts) #185 
- Code repetition: option to repeate code including header and footer #186 
- To make the scripts more variable, the pen-up/down code will be available as subroutines O97 and O98 - callable from the tool-change scripts. Then it's easier to switch from real Z movement to servo-control. 
- Option to control the servo during setup of the Servo PWM values 

Bug fixes: 
- Bug fix: Text to Gcode - allow leading space 
- Bug fix: Using Z-Axis with 'several passes': inital 'Pen up' was nok 
- Bug fix: described in #186 MainFormStreaming - Line 186 
- Improovement in Tool change script handling #184 
- Subroutines O97 and O98 will only be generated if subroutine calls are found in tool-change scripts. 
- Fixed Problem: during streaming, sometimes commands are missing. 
- Bug fix in Tool change script handling #184 
 
 
### 2021-02 Version 1.5.6.x 
- Problem: If using a servo (controlled via spindle PWM) the PWM will be set to '0' on program end M30 (because grbl will reset the parser state).
Depending on hardware setup, this will lower the pen and draw a dot.
To avoid this, the only way is to skip the M30 command.
- GampePad: add PointOfViewControllers0
- Simple Shapes: add "Round off Z" to generate 1/4 circle round off on edge of workpiece

- Added Arduino-Nano binary 'grbl_v1.1f_Servo_switch_dir_step.hex' for use with cheap nano-cnc-shield where dir and step pins are switched,
 
Features to simplify manual work: 
- Added a jog path creator - [Menu - G-Code Creation - Create jog path]

### 2015-09 Start of GRBL-Plotter
After struggeling with an other GCode sender (just working when logged-in as admin) and missing features,
I started my own GCode sender. 
My main use is 2.5D usage for a CNC router and a plotter.  
The most disturbing points were:  
* no automatic reconnect, when starting the program
* no automatic set of the feed rate, when moving the stage the first time
* poor manual control (joystick) via user interface
